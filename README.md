# Typing-Speed-calculator
A simple React-based application that allows users to test their typing speed. It displays a fixed sentence and measures the time taken to type it accurately. The app calculates Words Per Minute (WPM), gives real-time feedback on correctness, and disables input once the sentence is typed correctly.
